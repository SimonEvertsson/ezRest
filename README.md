# ezRest
ezRest is an Anroid library that allows for easy http requests and background tasking. It is a library that has been developed during mine (Johan) and Simon Evertssons (https://github.com/SimonEvertsson) different undertakings. It has been gradually improved to fit new needs over time.

## The idea
As with my other ezLibraries ezRest is supposed to be super simple to use in it's most basic funtions, while still allowing for full customization when nessecary. 

So... let's get started!
